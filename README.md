MachineSleeping
===============

I have this sleep cycle app on my iPhone that generates some cool data on how I sleep. It turns out I can export some of this data to a csv to play around with! I have a habit of putting labels on how I slept when I wake up like (:), :(, or :|), so I figured why not use some machine learning and build a classifier to see when I should sleep?

I didn't spend much time on this project because it seems that the labels that I assign when I wake up are pretty much useless. The classifications I make are WAY too noisy to be able to extract anything meaningful. Oh well...

Although I am shelving this project for now, I think I will come back to it when I don't have finals and add some nontrivial features. Maybe switch to a SVM or perceptron.
